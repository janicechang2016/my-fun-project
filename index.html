<h1>Alpacas</h1>

<h2>Why are alpacas so great?</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Alpacas were domesticated by the Incas more than 6,000 years ago and raised for their exquisite fleece.</li>

	<li>Their fiber is much like sheep's wool, but warmer and not itchy; and it is hypoallergenic!</li>

	<li>Their fiber comes in 22 colors and hundreds of shades, from white to light rose gray to dark fawn, so there's no need for pollution-intensive dyeing.</li>
